                <p>
                  Sarah was born in October 1989 in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Thomas and Elizabeth Dygard. Tom was an organic farmer and professional chef, growing many of the ingredients used in the home-made meals he was teaching his children to prepare.
                  Sarah and her siblings were all taught to cook from an early age, learning the benefit and importance of fresh ingredients.  Very early on, the family moved to Jordan, Indiana, to a much larger farm. She played baseball, basketball and soccer on local teams, made art and music, and cooked.
                  The weekly ritual of preparing pizza or lasagna and watching IU basketball was ingrained in the family, and Sarah took to Italian cooking (and pancakes) like a fish to water.

                <hr class="hr-divider hr-about">
                <p>
                  After the passing of her father at age 10, Sarah moved back to Indianapolis with her mother. She continued her attention to art, music and cooking pursuits at Nora Middle School and then North Central High School. After moving out on her own, she worked on expanding her culinary horizons but never shook her love of Italian inspired pastas, pizza and lasagnas.
                  She was well-known in personal circles for arriving at a social gathering with a bag of fresh ingredients and making an entire pizza or lasagna from scratch. When she set herself to learning to make pasta, she would often make far too much and give away batches of farfalle or raviolis to family and friends.
                  These gifts became such surprise treasures that people began offering to buy batches to-order, and a local restauranteur became interested in her products. Sarah decided it was time to pursue the art she loved as a profession.
